# Portfolio

## Description

This application showcases my development skills through the website itself, as well as through the projects displayed in the "Portfolio" section.

Use the navigation bar at the top of the page to browse through the site and simplify your search. 
I've included a few of my previous projects, as well as my resume and contact information. 

I look forward to working with you.
